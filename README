== lpssh ==

lpssh is a late parallel SSH client written in Erlang.

Why another parallel SSH client? Because of *massive* parallelism of Erlang.
It can complete call to 800 servers under 50 seconds with no noticeable load
on caller host.

Another thing is that lpssh uses notion of hosts inventory. Most of other
tools out there only allow to specify each host in command line.
lpssh provides a way of listing hosts known by some inventory, be it an
application, flat file or a shell command. You provide a query understood by
underlying inventory and lpssh calls each of the listed hosts. Of course, you
can still provide hosts by their names.
